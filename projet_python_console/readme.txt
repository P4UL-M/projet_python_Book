PLEASE CONCIDER READING THE REAM.ME IN THE TKINTER PROJECT BEFORE THIS ONE PLEASE


Some functions may not be coded the exact way in both projects because we had to modify them so they could be used in Tkinter


Some functionalities are present in the Tkinter project and not in this one :
    - Here we don't store the style of a book because we don't have to display it with colors like in the Tkinter version
    - Here the recommend book function can recommend less than 10 books since we don't have to display a long list of books
using scroll bar like in the Tkinter project, however in this version the program still recommend the most rated books 
if the user didn't read anything
    - The verification of the data is not present here (we only initialize new files if they are not present) since this version doesn't have
the required functions (books() and readers())


If you struggle using any functions, please consider using the 'help' function, it will show you every available functions with
its input and what the function does as output.
